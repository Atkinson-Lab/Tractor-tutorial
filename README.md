## Tractor - A GWAS tool for admixed population 

Welcome to Tractor!

For a comprehensive understanding of Tractor's methodology and application, we invite you to read our following **2021 Nature Genetics publication** [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-020-00766-y). 

> Atkinson, E.G., Maihofer, A.X., Kanai, M. et al. Tractor uses local ancestry to enable the inclusion of admixed individuals in GWAS and to boost power. Nat Genet 53, 195â€“204 (2021).

To facilitate users in implementing the method, we've curated a series of tutorials available here. These tutorials cover each step of the Tractor pipeline using a toy dataset. Please [download](https://github.com/Atkinson-Lab/Tractor-tutorial/blob/main/tutorial-data.zip) and unzip the provided file with the toy data to follow along.

Please note that while this tutorial offers a high-level guide to running Tractor, users are advised to ensure the reliability and accuracy of phasing and local ancestry inference, as these factors influence the Tractor GWAS results.


## Tractor pipeline step-by-step tutorials:

- **Step 0**: [Phasing and Local Ancestry Inference](Rfmix.md)
- **Step 1**: [Recovering Tracts](Recover.md)
- **Step 2**: [Extracting tracts and ancestry dosages](Extract.md)
- **Step 3a**: [Tractor GWAS with local implementation (suitable for smaller dataset)](Local.md)
- **Step 3b**: [Tractor GWAS with Hail (suitable for large scale analysis)](Hail.md)
