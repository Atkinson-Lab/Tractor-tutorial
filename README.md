## Tractor - A GWAS tool for admixed population 

Thanks for your interest in Tractor!

The methodology and utility of Tractor is more fully described in our publication [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-020-00766-y), "Tractor uses local ancestry to enable the inclusion of admixed individuals in GWAS and to boost power", which is was published in Nature Genetics here. We ask that you cite this manuscript for work utilizing the Tractor software.

&nbsp;  


We prepared a series of tutorials that go over each step of Tractor pipeline with a toy dataset. Please download and unzip the [file](https://github.com/Atkinson-Lab/Tractor-tutorial/blob/main/tutorial-data.zip) if you hope to follow. 

(This tutorial only serve as a high-level guideline to run Tractor, and itâ€™s the users' responsibility to make sure phasing and local ancestry inference is reliable before running Tractor)
