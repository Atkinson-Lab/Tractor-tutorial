## Intuition

Tractor implicitly assumes that the risk alleles that reside in different local ancestry background present different effect size, and therefore performing LAI may provide better biological insights, allows a less-biased estimates, and potentially increase power. Here in this section, we will first compare Tractor with standard GWAS analysis, and admixture mapping, and we will then go over `RunTractor.py` to run Tractor method locally or in a HPC setting.
